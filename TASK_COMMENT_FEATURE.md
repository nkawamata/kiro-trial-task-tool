# Task Comment Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive task comment system that allows users to add, edit, and delete comments on tasks. The feature includes comment truncation (showing only the latest 10 comments with a "more available" indicator) and proper user authentication.

## Backend Implementation

### Database Schema
- **New Table**: `TaskComments` with the following structure:
  - `id` (Primary Key): Unique comment identifier
  - `taskId`: Reference to the task
  - `userId`: Reference to the comment author
  - `content`: Comment text (max 1000 characters)
  - `createdAt`: Creation timestamp
  - `updatedAt`: Last modification timestamp

- **Global Secondary Index**: `TaskIndex` on `taskId` and `createdAt` for efficient comment retrieval

### Services
- **TaskCommentService**: Handles all comment operations
  - `getTaskComments()`: Retrieves comments for a task with pagination
  - `createComment()`: Creates new comments with validation
  - `updateComment()`: Updates existing comments (author-only)
  - `deleteComment()`: Deletes comments (author-only)
  - `getCommentsWithTruncation()`: Returns comments with truncation logic

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/comments/task/:taskId` - Get comments for a task
- `POST /api/comments/task/:taskId` - Create a new comment
- `PUT /api/comments/:commentId` - Update a comment
- `DELETE /api/comments/:commentId` - Delete a comment

### Security Features
- Authentication required for all comment operations
- Users can only edit/delete their own comments
- Task access validation (users must have access to the task to comment)
- Content validation (max 1000 characters, non-empty)

## Frontend Implementation

### Components
- **TaskComments**: Main component displaying comments and comment form
- **CommentItem**: Individual comment display with edit/delete functionality
- **Comment Form**: New comment creation with character counter

### Features
- **Real-time Updates**: Comments update immediately after operations
- **Inline Editing**: Click-to-edit functionality for comment authors
- **Character Limit**: Visual feedback for 1000 character limit
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+Enter to submit comments
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly comment interface
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error display and recovery

### Hooks
- **useTaskComments**: Custom hook managing comment state and operations
  - Loading states
  - Error handling
  - CRUD operations
  - Automatic refresh

## Truncation Logic
- Shows latest 10 comments by default
- Displays "More comments available" indicator when there are additional comments
- Comments are sorted by creation date (newest first)
- Efficient pagination using DynamoDB GSI

## Infrastructure Updates
- Added `TASK_COMMENTS` table to DynamoDB configuration
- Updated CDK stack to include comments table
- Added environment variables for comments table
- Updated database creation scripts

## Usage
1. Navigate to any task detail page
2. Scroll to the comments section at the bottom
3. Add comments using the text area and "Comment" button
4. Edit your own comments using the menu (three dots)
5. Delete your own comments if needed
6. View comment timestamps and edit indicators

## Database Scripts
- `npm run db:create-comments-table` - Create comments table only
- `npm run db:create-tables` - Create all tables including comments

## Security Considerations
- All comment operations require authentication
- Users can only modify their own comments
- Task access is validated before allowing comments
- Input sanitization and validation on both client and server
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

## Performance Optimizations
- Efficient GSI queries for comment retrieval
- Pagination to limit data transfer
- Client-side caching of comment data
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## Future Enhancements
- Comment reactions (like/dislike)
- Comment threading/replies
- Rich text formatting
- File attachments
- Comment notifications
- Comment search functionality

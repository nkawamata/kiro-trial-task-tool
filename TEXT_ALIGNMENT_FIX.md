# Text Alignment Fix - Center Alignment Issue

## Problem
Despite setting `textAlign: 'center'`, the day numbers in the timeline header were still appearing left-aligned.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by having nested Box elements with conflicting alignment properties:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC STRUCTURE
<Box sx={{ justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <Box sx={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>  // This wasn't working properly
    {tick.label}
  </Box>
</Box>
```

The nested structure was preventing the text alignment from working correctly.

## Solution
Removed the nested Box and applied all text styling directly to the container element:

```typescript
// FIXED STRUCTURE
<Box sx={{
  // Container properties
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  
  // Text properties applied directly
  fontSize: '0.75rem',
  fontWeight: tick.isMainTick ? 'bold' : 'normal',
  color: '...',
  textAlign: 'center',  // Now works properly
  lineHeight: 1,
  userSelect: 'none'
}}>
  {tick.label}  // Text directly in the styled container
</Box>
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Eliminated Nested Box Structure
- **Before**: Container Box → Inner Box → Text
- **After**: Container Box → Text (direct)

### 2. Consolidated Styling
- All text-related styles now applied to the same element that contains the text
- No more style conflicts between parent and child elements

### 3. Direct Text Alignment
- `textAlign: 'center'` now applies directly to the element containing the text
- Works in harmony with `justifyContent: 'center'` and `alignItems: 'center'`

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/gantt/GanttTimeline.tsx`

### Style Properties Applied Directly
```typescript
sx={{
  // Layout
  position: 'absolute',
  display: 'flex',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  
  // Sizing
  width: '50px',
  maxWidth: '50px',
  
  // Text styling (now direct)
  fontSize: '0.75rem',
  fontWeight: tick.isMainTick ? 'bold' : 'normal',
  color: '...',
  textAlign: 'center',  // ✅ Now works!
  lineHeight: 1,
  userSelect: 'none',
  
  // Other properties...
}}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **Perfect Text Centering**
- Day numbers now appear exactly centered in their cells
- No more left-aligned text
- Consistent alignment across all day cells

### ✅ **Simplified Structure**
- Cleaner component structure with fewer nested elements
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Better performance with fewer DOM elements

### ✅ **Reliable Styling**
- No more conflicts between parent and child styles
- Predictable text alignment behavior
- Consistent visual appearance

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. All day numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) appear centered in their cells
2. Both regular and bold numbers (main ticks) are properly centered
3. Weekend styling maintains proper centering
4. Hover effects don't affect text alignment

This fix resolves the persistent text alignment issue by eliminating the nested Box structure that was preventing proper text centering.

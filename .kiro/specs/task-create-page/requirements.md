# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a dedicated task creation page that allows users to create new tasks with comprehensive details, project assignment, team member assignment, scheduling, and dependency management. The page will provide an intuitive interface for capturing all necessary task information while ensuring proper validation and integration with the existing multi-project task management system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to create new tasks with detailed information, so that I can properly plan and assign work within my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the task creation page THEN the system SHALL display a form with all required task fields
2. WHEN a user fills in the task title field THEN the system SHALL validate that the title is not empty and contains at least 3 characters
3. WHEN a user selects a project THEN the system SHALL populate the assignee dropdown with project members only
4. WHEN a user submits a valid task form THEN the system SHALL create the task and redirect to the task list or project view
5. IF a user submits an invalid form THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors without losing form data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to set task priorities, deadlines, and effort estimates, so that the team can properly plan and prioritize work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a task priority THEN the system SHALL allow selection from Low, Medium, High, and Urgent options
2. WHEN a user sets start and end dates THEN the system SHALL validate that the end date is after the start date
3. WHEN a user enters estimated hours THEN the system SHALL accept only positive numeric values
4. WHEN a user sets dates THEN the system SHALL ensure dates fall within the project timeline if a project is selected
5. IF no dates are provided THEN the system SHALL allow task creation with optional scheduling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project coordinator, I want to assign tasks to specific team members and set dependencies, so that work can be properly coordinated and sequenced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a project THEN the system SHALL display only team members who have access to that project
2. WHEN a user searches for task dependencies THEN the system SHALL show existing tasks from the same project
3. WHEN a user selects task dependencies THEN the system SHALL prevent circular dependency creation
4. WHEN a user assigns a task to a team member THEN the system SHALL validate that the assignee has appropriate project access
5. IF no assignee is selected THEN the system SHALL allow task creation as unassigned

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate easily to and from the task creation page, so that I can efficiently manage my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any page with task management capabilities THEN the system SHALL provide a "Create Task" button or link
2. WHEN a user clicks "Create Task" from a project view THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the project field with the current project
3. WHEN a user cancels task creation THEN the system SHALL return them to the previous page without saving changes
4. WHEN a user successfully creates a task THEN the system SHALL redirect to an appropriate view (task list, project view, or task detail)
5. WHEN a user navigates away without saving THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation if form data exists

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the task creation form to be responsive and accessible, so that I can create tasks from any device and all team members can use the interface effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the task creation page on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout
2. WHEN a user navigates the form using keyboard only THEN the system SHALL provide proper tab order and focus management
3. WHEN a user uses screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN form validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL announce errors to assistive technologies
5. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL focus on the first form field for immediate input

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want task creation to integrate properly with existing authentication and authorization, so that users can only create tasks in projects they have access to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access the task creation page THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
2. WHEN a user accesses the task creation page THEN the system SHALL only show projects where the user has member-level access or higher
3. WHEN a user tries to create a task in a project without proper permissions THEN the system SHALL display an authorization error
4. WHEN a user creates a task THEN the system SHALL record the creator's information for audit purposes
5. IF a user's session expires during task creation THEN the system SHALL preserve form data and prompt for re-authentication

# Team Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive team management system for the multi-project task management tool. Teams are groups of users that can be associated with projects, providing an additional layer of organization and access control.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Team Management
- **Create Teams**: Users can create teams with name and description
- **Team Roles**: Owner, Admin, Member hierarchy with appropriate permissions
- **Team CRUD**: Full create, read, update, delete operations for teams
- **User Teams**: Users can be members of multiple teams with different roles

### 2. Team Membership
- **Add/Remove Members**: Team owners and admins can manage team membership
- **Role Management**: Update member roles within teams
- **Permission Control**: Role-based access to team management functions
- **User Search**: Search and add users to teams

### 3. Project-Team Integration
- **Team-Project Association**: Teams can be linked to projects
- **Access Control**: Team members gain project access through team membership
- **Project Access**: Users can access projects through direct membership OR team membership
- **Team Project Management**: Add/remove teams from projects

### 4. Database Schema
Added three new DynamoDB tables:
- **Teams**: Store team information (id, name, description, ownerId, timestamps)
- **TeamMembers**: Store team membership (id, teamId, userId, role, joinedAt)
- **ProjectTeams**: Store project-team associations (id, projectId, teamId, addedAt)

## Types and Interfaces

### Shared Types
```typescript

  description?: string;
  ownerId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface TeamMember {
  id: string;
  teamId: string;
  userId: string;
  role: TeamRole;
  joinedAt: Date;
}

interface ProjectTeam {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  teamId: string;
  addedAt: Date;
}

enum TeamRole {
  OWNER = 'owner',
  ADMIN = 'admin',
  MEMBER = 'member'
}
```

## Database Tables

### Teams Table
- Primary Key: `id`
- GSI: `OwnerIdIndex` on `ownerId`
- Attributes: id, name, description, ownerId, createdAt, updatedAt

### TeamMembers Table
- Primary Key: `id`
- GSI: `TeamIdIndex` on `teamId`
- GSI: `UserIdIndex` on `userId`
- Attributes: id, teamId, userId, role, joinedAt

### ProjectTeams Table
- Primary Key: `id`
- GSI: `ProjectIdIndex` on `projectId`
- GSI: `TeamIdIndex` on `teamId`
- Attributes: id, projectId, teamId, addedAt

## Permission Model

### Team Permissions
- **Owner**: Full control (manage members, update team, delete team, add to projects)
- **Admin**: Manage members, update team, add to projects
- **Member**: View team, view members

### Project Access
Users can access projects through:
1. **Direct membership**: Added as individual project member
2. **Team membership**: Member of a team associated with the project
3. **Project ownership**: Owner of the project

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Team
```typescript
const team = await teamsService.createTeam({
  name: "Frontend Team",
  description: "Responsible for UI/UX development"
});
```

### Adding Team to Project
```typescript
await teamsService.addTeamToProject(teamId, projectId);
```

### Managing Team Members
```typescript
// Add member
await teamsService.addTeamMember(teamId, {
  userId: "user123",
  role: TeamRole.MEMBER
});

// Update role
await teamsService.updateTeamMemberRole(teamId, userId, {
  role: TeamRole.ADMIN
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Scalable Organization**: Teams provide a scalable way to organize users across multiple projects
2. **Simplified Access Management**: Add entire teams to projects instead of individual users
3. **Role-Based Permissions**: Clear hierarchy with appropriate permissions
4. **Flexible Membership**: Users can be in multiple teams with different roles
5. **Project Flexibility**: Projects can have both individual members and team members

## Next Steps

1. **Navigation Integration**: Add team routes to main navigation
2. **Project Creation Enhancement**: Allow selecting teams during project creation
3. **Notifications**: Add team-based notifications for project updates
4. **Analytics**: Team-based reporting and analytics
5. **Team Templates**: Predefined team structures for common use cases

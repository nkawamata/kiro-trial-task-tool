# Workload View Updates

## Overview
Updated the Workload View implementation to remove Quick Actions and modify the TimeRange options as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Quick Actions Section
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/workload/WorkloadDashboard.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed the entire Quick Actions section that was displaying action cards
- **Impact**: Cleaner, more focused workload dashboard without the quick action buttons

### 2. Updated TimeRange Options
- **Files**: 
  - `frontend/src/components/workload/WorkloadDashboard.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/pages/WorkloadView.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced old options (`This Week`, `Last 30 Days`, `Last 90 Days`)
  - New options: `This Week`, `Next Week`, `After Two Weeks`, `After Three Weeks`
  - Updated TypeScript types to reflect new range values
  - Modified date calculation logic to handle future week ranges

### 3. Date Range Calculation Updates
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/WorkloadView.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated import to use `addWeeks` instead of `subDays`
  - Modified `getDateRange` function to calculate future week ranges
  - Each option now calculates the start and end of the respective week

## Technical Details

### New TimeRange Type
```typescript
type DateRange = 'thisWeek' | 'nextWeek' | 'afterTwoWeeks' | 'afterThreeWeeks';
```

### Date Calculation Logic
- **This Week**: Current week (start to end)
- **Next Week**: Week starting 7 days from now
- **After Two Weeks**: Week starting 14 days from now  
- **After Three Weeks**: Week starting 21 days from now

### Removed Components
- Quick Actions card section with buttons for:
  - Allocate Work
  - Bulk Allocation
  - Redistribute
  - Generate Report
  - Refresh Data

## Impact
- Simplified user interface focused on workload visualization
- Future-oriented time range selection for better planning
- Cleaner dashboard layout without action buttons
- Maintained all core workload functionality (calendar, team view, analytics, insights)

## Usage
The updated Workload View now provides:
1. Clean header with title and Allocate Work button
2. Time range selector with future week options
3. Tabbed interface for different workload views
4. No quick actions section for a more streamlined experience

The workload allocation functionality is still accessible through the main "Allocate Work" button in the header.

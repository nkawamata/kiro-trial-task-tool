# Workload Team Calendar View Implementation

## Overview
Modified the Workload Dashboard TEAM view to replace the Team Overview and Individual Workload sections with a detailed team workload calendar table.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Service Enhancement
**File: `backend/src/services/workloadService.ts`**
- Added `getTeamDailyWorkload()` method to aggregate workload data by user and date
- Returns a nested object structure: `{ [userId: string]: { [date: string]: number } }`

### 2. Backend API Endpoint
**File: `backend/src/routes/workload.ts`**
- Added new endpoint: `GET /api/workload/team/daily`
- Accepts `projectId`, `startDate`, and `endDate` query parameters
- Returns daily workload breakdown for all team members in a project

### 3. Frontend Redux Store
**File: `frontend/src/store/slices/workloadSlice.ts`**
- Added `dailyWorkload` to the state interface
- Created `fetchTeamDailyWorkload` async thunk action
- Added reducer cases to handle the new action

### 4. WorkloadTeamView Component Redesign
**File: `frontend/src/components/workload/WorkloadTeamView.tsx`**

#### Removed Components:
- Team Overview card (member count, overloaded/available stats)
- Individual Workload list (utilization bars and progress indicators)
- Detailed Team Workload table (summary statistics)

#### New Calendar Table Features:
- **X-axis**: Days of the current month with day names and dates
- **Y-axis**: Team member list with avatars and names
- **Cell Values**: Total allocation hours for each member per day
- **Color Coding**: Hours displayed as colored chips (0h=none, 1-4h=green, 5-6h=blue, 7-8h=orange, 9+h=red)
- **Interactive Cells**: Click any cell to open task allocation dialog for that member and date
- **Weekend Highlighting**: Weekend columns have gray background
- **Sticky Headers**: Member names and dates remain visible during scrolling

### 5. Dialog Integration
**File: `frontend/src/components/workload/WorkloadDayAllocationDialog.tsx`**
- Added optional `userId` prop to support viewing/editing any team member's allocations
- Maintains backward compatibility for current user workflows

### 6. Dashboard Layout Update
**File: `frontend/src/components/workload/WorkloadDashboard.tsx`**
- Simplified Team tab layout by removing the grid structure
- Moved project filter to a compact horizontal layout above the calendar
- Removed unused Grid import

## User Experience Improvements

### Calendar View Benefits:
1. **Visual Overview**: See entire month's workload distribution at a glance
2. **Quick Navigation**: Click any cell to drill down into specific day allocations
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Easily spot overloaded days, gaps, and distribution patterns
4. **Efficient Management**: Direct access to task allocation from calendar cells

### Interaction Flow:
1. Select a project from the dropdown filter
2. View team workload calendar for current month
3. Click any cell showing hours to open allocation dialog
4. View/edit/add task allocations for that member and date
5. Calendar automatically refreshes after changes

## Technical Details

### Data Flow:
1. Component dispatches `fetchTeamDailyWorkload` when project changes
2. Backend queries workload entries and aggregates by user/date
3. Frontend receives nested object with daily hour totals
4. Calendar renders cells with appropriate styling based on hours
5. Cell clicks trigger dialog with specific user/date context

### Performance Considerations:
- Sticky table headers for large team sizes
- Efficient data structure for O(1) cell value lookups
- Automatic refresh only when necessary (project changes, allocation updates)

### Responsive Design:
- Horizontal scrolling for months with many days
- Sticky left column for member names
- Compact cell design for mobile compatibility

## Future Enhancements
- Month navigation (previous/next month buttons)
- Multi-project view with project color coding
- Drag-and-drop allocation between days
- Bulk allocation operations
- Export calendar view to PDF/Excel

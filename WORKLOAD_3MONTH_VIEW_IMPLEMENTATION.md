# 3-Month Workload Calendar View Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a horizontal 3-month view for the workload dashboard calendar, displaying the previous month, current month, and next month side by side.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### WorkloadCalendar.tsx
1. **Layout Update**: Modified the calendar to display 3 months horizontally instead of a single month
2. **Data Fetching**: Updated to fetch workload data for 3 months (previous, current, next) in a single request
3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Added `Grid` import from Material-UI for better layout control
   - Created `renderSingleMonth()` function to render individual month calendars
   - Reduced cell sizes and font sizes to accommodate 3 months in the same space
   - Highlighted the current month with bold text and primary color
   - Updated navigation to show "3-Month Workload View" title

#### Key Function Changes
- **useEffect**: Now fetches data for 3-month range instead of single month
- **renderCalendarDays()**: Modified to accept a month parameter for rendering specific months
- **renderSingleMonth()**: New function to render individual month calendars with proper styling
- **Navigation**: Updated refresh and allocation success callbacks to handle 3-month data range

#### Visual Improvements
- Reduced cell height from 120px to 100px to fit 3 months
- Adjusted font sizes and spacing for better readability in compact view
- Current month is visually emphasized with bold text and primary color
- Maintained all existing functionality (workload indicators, click handlers, etc.)

### Backend Compatibility
- No backend changes required - existing API endpoints handle date ranges efficiently
- The `fetchWorkloadEntries` and `fetchWorkloadSummary` functions already support custom date ranges
- Performance is maintained as we're fetching a larger range in fewer requests

## Benefits

1. **Better Overview**: Users can see workload distribution across 3 months at once
2. **Improved Planning**: Easier to plan and balance workload across multiple months
3. **Reduced Navigation**: Less need to navigate between months to see adjacent periods
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features (allocation, editing, indicators) still work
5. **Performance**: Single API call for 3 months instead of multiple calls when navigating

## Usage

The calendar now displays:
- **Left**: Previous month (dimmed)
- **Center**: Current month (highlighted)
- **Right**: Next month (dimmed)

Users can:
- Navigate using left/right arrows to shift the 3-month window
- Click on any day in any month to add/edit allocations
- See workload indicators across all 3 months
- Use the refresh button to reload data for all 3 months

## Technical Details

### Data Range Calculation
```typescript
const prevMonth = subMonths(currentMonth, 1);
const nextMonth = addMonths(currentMonth, 1);
const startDate = format(startOfMonth(prevMonth), 'yyyy-MM-dd');
const endDate = format(endOfMonth(nextMonth), 'yyyy-MM-dd');
```

### Responsive Design
- Uses flexbox layout for horizontal arrangement
- Each month takes equal width (flex: 1)
- Maintains responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Compact design optimized for 3-month display

The implementation provides a comprehensive 3-month workload view while maintaining all existing functionality and improving the user experience for workload planning and management.

**How This Happens**: Each team member logs into the system and creates their own workload allocations for their part of the task:
- **Sarah** (Backend): Allocates 6h on Jan 15 and 3h on Jan 18 for her backend work
- **Mike** (Frontend): Allocates 4h on Jan 16 for frontend development  
- **Alex** (Testing): Allocates 3h on Jan 17 for testing and QA

```

## User Benefits

### For Sarah (Task Assignee)
- **Task Ownership**: Sees that the task is assigned to her overall
- **Her Allocations**: Can see and edit her own workload allocations (9h total)
- **Team Collaboration**: Sees that Mike and Alex are also contributing to the task
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors her 88.9% efficiency rate (8h actual vs 9h allocated)

### For Mike (Team Member & Project Manager)
- **Dual Role**: Sees his own allocation (4h) and can view the overall task progress
- **Team Visibility**: Can see all team members working on the task
- **Resource Coordination**: Understands how work is distributed across the team
- **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks individual and collective progress on the task

### For Team Leads
- **User Attribution**: Every allocation and time entry is clearly attributed
- **Contact Information**: Easy access to team member contact details
- **Performance Metrics**: Efficiency rates help identify training needs
- **Workload Distribution**: See who is creating allocations vs doing work

## Key User Information Features

### 1. Assignee Context
- All metrics and actions are clearly attributed to the assigned user
- Contact information readily available
- User-specific efficiency calculations

### 2. Allocation Attribution
- Shows who each workload allocation is for (from the workload form input)
- Can display different users for different allocations on the same task
- Provides contact information for each person allocated to work

### 3. User Activity Metrics
- Efficiency rate calculation (actual vs allocated hours)
- Average daily allocation for workload planning
- Date range showing allocation span

### 4. Visual User Identification
- Person icons for easy visual identification
- Consistent user information display
- Clear separation between different users

## How Multi-User Allocations Work

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Task Assignment**: Sarah is assigned the "Implement User Authentication" task
2. **Team Planning**: Team discusses and divides the work:
   - Sarah: Backend API development
   - Mike: Frontend UI components  
   - Alex: Testing and QA
3. **Individual Allocation**: Each team member creates their own workload allocations:
   - **Sarah logs in** → Opens Workload view → Allocates 6h on Jan 15, 3h on Jan 18
   - **Mike logs in** → Opens Workload view → Allocates 4h on Jan 16
   - **Alex logs in** → Opens Workload view → Allocates 3h on Jan 17
4. **Progress Tracking**: Each person logs their actual hours as they work
5. **Visibility**: Anyone viewing the task can see all allocations from all team members

### Key Points
- **Self-Service**: Each person creates their own allocations
- **No Manager Override**: The system doesn't allow managers to allocate for others
- **Collaborative Visibility**: All allocations appear together in the task view
- **Individual Responsibility**: Each person manages their own time tracking

## Real-World Usage

### Scenario 1: Daily Standup
- **Sarah**: "I've completed 5.5h of my 6h backend work, with 3h more planned for tomorrow"
- **Mike**: "Frontend is done - 4h as planned, ready for integration"  
- **Alex**: "Testing took 2.5h of the planned 3h, found some minor issues to address"

### Scenario 2: Resource Planning
Project manager can analyze: "This task needed 16h total across 3 people. Sarah (backend) needed 9h, Mike (frontend) 4h, Alex (testing) 3h. Good distribution for similar future tasks."

### Scenario 3: Team Review
Team lead can identify: "Authentication task shows good collaboration - Sarah handled backend (9h), Mike did frontend (4h), Alex covered testing (3h). Each person self-allocated and tracked their own work."

### Scenario 4: Performance Review
Manager can note: "Team shows good self-management - Sarah (88.9% efficiency), Mike (100% efficiency), Alex (83.3% efficiency). All team members accurately self-allocate and track their work."

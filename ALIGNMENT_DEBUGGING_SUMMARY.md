# Alignment Debugging Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Container Size Problem
- MuiBox-root containers were too large and overlapping
- Caused by complex positioning calculations

### 2. Positioning Mismatch
- Timeline header cells and task positioning used different calculations
- Led to misalignment between headers and task bars

### 3. Text Centering vs Alignment Conflict
- Attempts to center text broke the alignment with tasks
- Complex centering methods interfered with positioning

## Current Simplified Approach

### Back to Basics Strategy
```typescript
// Simple, consistent positioning
sx={{
  position: 'absolute',
  left: `${position}%`,        // Same as task positioning
  width: '50px',               // Standard width
  paddingLeft: '4px',          // Simple left padding
  display: 'flex',
  alignItems: 'center',
  // ... other properties
}}
```

### Key Principles
1. **Alignment First**: Get headers and tasks aligned before centering text
2. **Same Calculations**: Use identical positioning for headers and tasks
3. **Simple Approach**: Avoid complex centering that breaks alignment
4. **Standard Sizing**: Use consistent 50px width without complex adjustments

## Lessons Learned

### What Didn't Work
- `calc(${position}% - 25px)` - Broke alignment with tasks
- Complex nested Box structures - Created conflicts
- Multiple centering methods - Caused interference
- Margin-based centering - Disrupted positioning

### What Should Work
- `left: ${position}%` - Same as task positioning
- Simple padding for text spacing
- Standard container sizes
- Consistent calculation methods

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Fix Alignment
- Ensure headers align with task positions
- Verify day borders align with task starts
- Confirm month headers align with first days

### Phase 2: Improve Text Centering
- Once alignment is correct, work on text centering
- Use simple methods that don't break positioning
- Test each change to ensure alignment is maintained

## Current Status
- Reverted to simple positioning approach
- Using `left: ${position}%` for consistency
- Standard 50px width containers
- Basic left padding for text spacing

This should fix the fundamental alignment issues before addressing text centering.

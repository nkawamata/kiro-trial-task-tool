# Workload Day Allocation Dialog Feature

## Overview
Modified the Workload Dashboard Calendar View to show a detailed allocation dialog when clicking on day-of-month cells. The new dialog displays all allocated tasks for the selected date and allows users to view, edit, and delete workload entries.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: WorkloadDayAllocationDialog
**File:** `frontend/src/components/workload/WorkloadDayAllocationDialog.tsx`

**Features:**
- Shows all workload entries for a selected date
- Displays task names, project names, and allocated hours
- Provides edit and delete functionality for each entry
- Shows daily summary with total hours and capacity warnings
- Allows adding new allocations for the selected date
- Color-coded workload indicators (green for light, red for overloaded)

**Key Functionality:**
- Lists all tasks allocated for the selected day
- Shows project context for each task
- Provides quick edit/delete actions via icon buttons
- Integrates with existing WorkloadAllocationDialog for editing
- Real-time updates after changes

### 2. Enhanced WorkloadAllocationDialog
**File:** `frontend/src/components/workload/WorkloadAllocationDialog.tsx`

**New Features:**
- Support for editing existing workload entries
- Disabled project/task selection when editing (prevents data corruption)
- Dynamic dialog title and button text based on mode (create vs edit)
- Pre-populated form data when editing an entry

**Changes:**
- Added `editingEntry` prop to support edit mode
- Updated form handling to distinguish between create and update operations
- Modified API calls to use PATCH for updates, POST for new entries
- Disabled project/task fields during editing to maintain data integrity

### 3. Updated WorkloadCalendar Component
**File:** `frontend/src/components/workload/WorkloadCalendar.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Replaced direct allocation dialog with day allocation dialog on cell click
- Added import for new WorkloadDayAllocationDialog component
- Updated click handlers to open the appropriate dialog
- Maintained existing "Add Allocation" button functionality
- Removed unused Grid import to fix linting warnings

### 4. Backend API Enhancements
**File:** `backend/src/routes/workload.ts`

**Enhanced PATCH Endpoint:**
- Updated `/workload/:workloadId` endpoint to support full entry updates
- Maintains backward compatibility for actual hours updates
- Supports updating allocated hours, date, and other fields
- Intelligent routing based on request body content

**File:** `backend/src/services/workloadService.ts`

**New Method:**
- Added `updateWorkloadEntry()` method for comprehensive entry updates
- Handles date parsing and formatting consistently
- Maintains existing `updateWorkloadActualHours()` for backward compatibility
- Proper error handling and logging

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Clicking on calendar cells opened allocation dialog for new entries only
- No way to view existing allocations for a specific date
- No quick edit/delete functionality
- Limited visibility into daily workload distribution

### After
- Clicking on calendar cells shows detailed day view with all allocations
- Clear list of all tasks allocated for the selected date
- Quick edit/delete actions for each entry
- Visual indicators for workload capacity (over 8 hours shows warning)
- Easy access to add more allocations for the same date
- Better project context for each task

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. User clicks on calendar day cell
2. WorkloadDayAllocationDialog opens with selected date
3. Component fetches workload entries for that specific date
4. Displays list of allocated tasks with project context
5. User can edit/delete entries or add new ones
6. Changes trigger data refresh in parent calendar component

### API Integration
- **GET** `/workload/entries` - Fetch entries for date range
- **PATCH** `/workload/:id` - Update existing entry (new functionality)
- **DELETE** `/workload/:id` - Delete entry (existing)
- **POST** `/workload/allocate` - Create new entry (existing)

### State Management
- Uses existing Redux workload slice
- Leverages existing project and task slices for context data
- Maintains local state for dialog management and loading states
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Benefits

1. **Better Visibility**: Users can see all tasks allocated for any given day
2. **Quick Actions**: Edit and delete functionality directly from the day view
3. **Context Awareness**: Shows project names alongside task names
4. **Capacity Management**: Visual warnings when daily allocation exceeds 8 hours
5. **Improved UX**: More intuitive workflow for managing daily workload
6. **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental project/task changes during edits

## Future Enhancements

1. **Drag & Drop**: Allow dragging tasks between days
2. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple entries for batch actions
3. **Time Tracking**: Integration with actual time logging
4. **Notifications**: Alerts for overallocation or conflicts
5. **Templates**: Save common allocation patterns for quick reuse
